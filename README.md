### Hi there, I\'m Sashmit :) {#hi-there-im-sashmit}

I\'m a 14-year-old robotics enthusiast and software developer currently
studying at the **University of Washington** **Seattle Campus** through
the Robinson Center\'s Early Entrance Program. My passion is in building
intelligent control software systems from the ground up, tackling
complex challenges in control systems, autonomous navigation, and
computer vision.

As the **Director of Software Engineering** for both an FRC and an FTC
team, I lead software architecture, develop core control and vision
systems, and mentor teammates to build highly competitive robots. When
I\'m not in the workshop, I enjoy building personal projects, mentoring
younger students in STEM, and exploring how technology can be used for
education.

<th><strong>FIRST Robotics (FRC &amp; FTC)</strong></th>
<th><p>As Director of Software on FTC 19708 and FRC 9023, I led the
development of an intelligent localization system fusing AprilTag vision
and wheel odometry data with a Kalman filter to achieve &lt;1cm position
accuracy. I also built a dynamic autonomous framework using pose-based
trajectories, developed an extremely reliable auto-align automation,
created intelligent intake systems with TensorFlow and OpenCV, and
derived direct and inverse kinematics models for various types of
arms.</p>

<th><strong>Flag Matching Game</strong></th>
<th><p>A timed quiz game built with vanilla JavaScript, featuring a
custom drag-and-drop UI, dynamic DOM generation, and an event-driven
state management system. A deep dive into front-end logic and
interactivity.</p>
<p>View on GitHub</p></th>

<tr class="odd">
<th><strong>Punnett Square Generator</strong></th>
<th><p>A web tool that dynamically generates Punnett squares for
multi-trait genetic crosses. It uses an iterative algorithm to calculate
all possible gamete combinations and determine phenotypic
probabilities.</p>
<p>View on GitHub</p></th>
</tr>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Custom Quadcopter</strong></th>
<th>Designed, 3D-printed, and programmed a drone from scratch. I used an
OpenSCAD script to programmatically generate propeller models. I also
implemented a PID control loop in Python on a BBC micro:bit to fuse IMU
and accelerometer data for a stable auto-hover and auto-land
feature.</th>
